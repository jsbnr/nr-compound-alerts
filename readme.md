# New Relic Compound (conditional) Alert
This example shows how you might use two policies to synthesize a compound alert. The idea being that you only alert if all the conditions in one policy are violating. Unfortunately due to the 2 hour limit on NRQL alerts this only works if the conditions all violate within the same 2 hour window. Its not ideal.
